# GamesJam2019-No-Longer-Home

This is the game produced during the Global Games Jam 2019.
Due to the time constraints and over-scoping, we could not finish the game. However, the first two levels are mostly playable.
We may come back to this game in the future, though it is not certain.

the monster in the house finds him.
